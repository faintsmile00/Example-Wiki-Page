# Example-Wiki-Page
Informational guide/wiki page, written in HTML with some simple styling in CSS.

Features a written guide for the champion Kassadin in the video game League of Legends, I did this so I could make an engaging example to show my friends who also play this game, as they would often be the ones giving me feedback on code.

Concise and informative guide, split into sections for ease of access and navigatable via a navbar.

Earlier project so CSS styling is extremely minimalistic, however is a good showcase of a written and informative guide.
