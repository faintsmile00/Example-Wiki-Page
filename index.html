   <p>Kassadin is a champion in League of Legends known for his exceptional mobility and disruptive abilities. Hailing from the Void, he wields dark powers to combat its encroachment on Runeterra.</p>

<p>In-game, Kassadin's signature ability is Riftwalk, allowing him to teleport short distances. He can disrupt enemies with Null Sphere, which damages and silences targets, and Force Pulse, emitting a wave that slows and damages enemies.</p>
   <p>Overall, Kassadin is a versatile and potent champion, capable of swiftly diving into enemy lines, disrupting formations, and eliminating high-priority targets. He remains a feared presence on the battlefield, striking fear into the hearts of his enemies with his mastery of the Void's powers.</p>

   <header id="sectionheader">Fundamentals</header>
    <p>Here I have tried to narrow down the 5 main aspects of playing kassa for those who are new to the champ.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Kassadin is prone to being counterpicked, it is rare that you will have a "safe" lane in any decent elo, so if you have ADHD maybe dont play this champ.</li>
      <li>2. Ability combos are important early on to survive laning phase and last hit, later on you will be able to roll your face across the keyboard a bit, but basic combo is E>Q>W>R>Auto.</li>
      <li>3. Managing your mana is extremely important. Your R doubles in cost and damage every consecutive use, and you can see your current stacks above your HUD. Late game you can maintain a 4 stack ult, but early on spamming of R pre-level 11/mana items will get you killed.</li>
      <li>4. It is important to itemize correctly, this will be explored in greater detail in the Build section. You can start looking to fight after Seraphs, as getting kills in teamfights or solo-killing your laner allows for safer farming and a quicker spike. Defensive items like Zhonyas, Frozen Heart or Abyssal Mask can be built for sustained teamfights without too much of a nerf to your damage.</li>
      <li>5. Level 11/16 spikes are important as your ultimate is the core of Kassadins kit. However, in the current season he is not a "hit 16 and win" champion, so dropping teamfights to sidelane for xp is not always worth it, especially in lower ranks where the apes will fight constantly without you.</li>
    <p>Most of these things will be covered in greater detail later on.</p>

  <section id="matchups" class="main-section">
   <header id="sectionheader">Matchups</header>
    <p>When you start playing this champion, you will have no "winning" matchups. All AD champs stomp kassa early due to his low base defence, and the "anti-mage" still loses lane pre-6 to almost all control mages/ap assassins.</p>
    <p>Unless you enjoy pain, ban or dodge Tristana, Akshan. Other ADC mids are also horrible but if you have a jungler can be punished. Akshan will 1v2 mid jg and trist can just jump out. These champs are not horrible because they will solokill you, but instead because they can shut you out of the game by denying farm.</p>
    <p>However, many laners will suffer from "ez lane syndrome", where they will make terrible plays because they assume you deal no damage. Kassadin's early auto-W-auto electrocute combo in the middle of a wave will half-health most champs, so dont be afraid to punish bad players jsut because your champ doesnt stomp lane early.</p>
    <p>Prioritise farm and not letting enemies deny you early. This can be done by positionig the wave close to tower, playing around jungler and punishing enemy for overextending. Post-lvl6 you can look to shove the wave and move to plays, kiting in and out with R and aiming to last hit kills for faster spikes.</p>
    <p>Control mage players are mostly handless idiots, they will spam abilities early to deny you farm, but most of them take TP not ignite and will run out of mana before they kill you. Use W to maintain your mana pool, then look to punish them post-6 with E>R>W when they are low on mana or have cooldowns. W on enemy champ restores a lot of mana, so bare this in mind when calculating all-in costs. </p>

  <section id="build" class="main-section">
   <header id="sectionheader">Build</header>
    <p>Your core currently is always Seraphs into Malignance. These items give everything kassa needs, ultimate haste, mana, ap and useful utility from passives. Rod of Ages is a good scaling item, but results in a slower spike which will feel especially punishing agaisnt faster paced champs. In games where you will be taking long sustained fights against melee champs, it can be a good option for its healing and bulk.</p>
    <p>Dark seal/mejais can be good for snowballing, but I am personally not a fan because I find on average I get more gold from kills in teamfights where I am not averse to dying.</p>
    <p>Boots are by default pen boots, but depending on matchup mercs/tabis are fine. Buy them after first item, get base boots earlier as the movement speed is helpful for dodging skillshots in lane.</p>
    <p>Third item can be Zhonyas or Rabadons. Whichever you don't build third can be built fourth. Zhonyas is good even into ap, as its active works fantastically around his short ultimate cooldowns. You can engage, fullcombo, zhonyas into R either to oneshot a low health target or to disengage if the fight goes poorly.<p>
    <p>Final item can be a pen item for full damage/carry or a defensive item if you are in more sustained teamfights. Frozen heart is fantastic as it gives mana and armour for a low cost, and can be bought earlier if needed. Abyssal mask compliments other AP champions on your team whilst giving you sustain agaisnt enemy poke mages. Banshees is a nice balance of offence/defence, and the shield can stop him being focused early on in fights before his R has ramped up.<p>

  <section id="lategame" class="main-section">
   <header id="sectionheader">Lategame</header>
    <p>How succesful you are as a Kassadin player often relies on how well you carry lategame teamfights. Provided you are suitably ahead, a 4stack R flash (flash during R animation) followed by suitable abilities (W for damage, E/Q for slow/chase) will evaporate any adc, assassin or mage. This can be followed up insatntly by as many casts of R as is neccesary to either finihs of the target, kill another or disengage.</p>
    <p>Champions you need to watch out for in the late game are usually toplaners. Most of those champs are disgustingly overtuned, and bruisers like darius, camille and riven can kill you while several items behind due to their ability to build full tank and still fist you. Unless extremely ahead, rely on your team to kite out these champions and all in them when they are low, looking out for survival items like steraks. Focus on killing enemy backline and squishies then 5v1 these broken champs.</p>
